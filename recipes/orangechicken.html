      <p>My kids are always begging me to take them to grab Chinese food.  They are obsessed with orange chicken but I am never really sure whats in itâ€¦.especially if they get it from a drive-thru. I wanted to create a version at home, made from scratch, with all-natural ingredients. It still has the same incredible flavor they love. Its definitely a win-win in our home.

        It is wintertime in Arizona which means that the citrus is ripe for the picking. I am surrounded by neighbors who have a plethora of fresh oranges and lemons hanging from their trees. This is the perfect time of year to whip up orange and lemon dishes especially this Chinese Orange Chicken.</p>
